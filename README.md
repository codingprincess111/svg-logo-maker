# SVG Logo Maker

This application allows users to enter inputs into an inquirer prompt in order to generate a logo.svg file, which will result in an SVG image. User will run node index.js and will be prompted questions that will automatically refresh into the logo.svg file. 

## Usage

User will run node index.js into the terminal that will prompt multiple questions: choose up to 3 characters, choose text color, choose shape color, and 3 arrow functional options to choose circle, square or triangle. SVG logo will be generated.
